      <h2>About Toca</h2>
      <p>
        Each training with Toca is structured to improve technical ability, individual mentality, and personal growth. 
        My players will be the first to tell you that I match their commitment: any time, any place, any condition. 
        These are the trainings I wish I had early on in my career.
        <br>
        Trainings are tailored to each player's goals, skillset, age, competition level, and schedule. Training sessions are held at Lakeside Sports Park in Orem, UT. See map below for details.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I started playing soccer at the age of two. I went on to play, watch, and coach soccer almost every day for the next 16 years. 
        After thousands of hours of training, I went on to play college soccer and gain an education at Brigham Young University. 
        I have been fortunate to be surrounded by incredible players and coaches throughout my career.
